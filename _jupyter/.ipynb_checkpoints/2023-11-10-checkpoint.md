    "This marks my first post in a hopefully long series of posts. I've recently graduated from a Masters of Science in Applied Mathematics and started working with the Machine Learning team over at Sellpy. One problem I've stumbled upon in my early days of my career is that I feel a disconnect from the interests and strengths I had in school to how it is to work with applied math in the industry where it feels that the core ideas are more product driven. That is not to say that I don't enjoy my work - because I really do - it's rather a testament for my passion to the field as a whole and maybe some slight frustration in the difficulty of trying to apply the theory I've learned over 5 years into something tangible.  \n",

    "With that said, my hope is for this blog to serve as a platform for me to investigate and expand on thoughts and ideas that go beyond the scope of my day to day work routine. My main interest are within the domain of data science for large scale systems, machine learning and statistical mathematics. I also have a fascination for nature and will surely try and delve into methods for subjects with\n",
